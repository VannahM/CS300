# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  For project one our goal was to create psuedocode for a vector, hash table, and binary search tree. The pseudocde should represent how the program would read a file into each 
  data structure checking for errors and then searching and printing out course info. Runtime analysis was done to compare each data structure. For project two our goal was to 
  use one data structure and create a program from our pseudocde that can read file into the data structure and allow a user to print out a sanple schedule and information about 
  courses.
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  Data structures are important to understand because they are teh foundation of programming. It is important to understand how they work and their strengths and weaknesses. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  The biggest road block I encountered while going through activities was needing to further my understanding of certain concepts. I spent much time reveiwing resources as well 
  doing extra research, like reveiwing my own personal C++ book, to help me understand and complete my assignments.
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  It has taught me that a lot more goes into desiging programs than just creating code. It is important to know what data structures to use and for what purposes. It has also 
  furthered my realization of how important psuedocde is to creating a program. 
  
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I have learned that it is important to use good coding practices when creating a program. Using modular design and thoroughly implementing error handling are important.
